# This is my local version control system

This project is a local version control system that has similar functionality to Git.

This was designed to develop a better understanding of how Git and version control systems in general work.

For comprehensive documentation, see the online spec (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp22/materials/proj/proj3/index.html).

Some of the functionality includes `init`, `add`, `commit`, `rm`, `log`, `global-log`, `find`, `status`, and `checkout`
